Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>

"Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart people i work with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. but they don't." Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, "and we got some amazing things done." Indeed, he and Apple had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in modern times: iMac, ipad, ipod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, ipad, App Store, OS X Lion--not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.</p>
