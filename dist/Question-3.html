Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>
